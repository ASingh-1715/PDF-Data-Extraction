The Department of Managed Health Care Notification

The California Department of Managed Health Care is responsible for regulating health care service plans. If you have a grievance against your health plan, you should
first telephone your health plan at (insert health plan's telephone number) and use your health plan's grievance process before contacting the department. Utilizing this
grievance procedure does not prohibit any potential legal rights or remedies that may be available to you. If you need help with a grievance involving an emergency, a
grievance that has not been satisfactorily resolved by your health plan, or a grievance that has remained unresolved for more than 30 days, you may call the department for
assistance. You may also be eligible for an Independent Medical Review (IMR). If you are eligible for IMR, the IMR process will provide an impartial review of medical
decisions made by a health plan related to the medical necessity of a proposed service or treatment, coverage decisions for treatments that are experimental or
investigational in nature and payment disputes for emergency or urgent medical services.

The department also has a toll-free telephone number (1-888-HMO-2219) and a TDD line (1-877-688-9891) for the hearing and speech impaired. The
department's Internet Web site http://www.hmohelp.ca.gov has complaint forms, IMR application forms and instructions online.
